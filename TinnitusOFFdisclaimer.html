     <h4>Thank You for choosing TinnitusOFF!</h4>
     <h4>Please read the following text carefully, it is in Your best interest!</h4>
     A team of medical doctors and engineers stand behind this app and strongly believe it will help You, if, as more than 200 million people around the world, You suffer from constantly hearing a ringing tone.<br /> 
TinnitusOFF uses tailor-made music notch therapy as a new scientifically proven treatment for tinnitus symptom relief. The core concept is to detect, process and extract the specific frequency of Your own tinnitus tone.<br />
Around 20% of people suffering from tinnitus are hearing two different tones, one in left, another one in right ear.<br />
After opening the app, You will be asked to detect and save the frequency of Your tone. If You have any difficulty for finding Your own tone’s frequency, do not hesitate to contact us. <br /><br /><br />
     <h4>How does it work?</h4>
     TinnitusOFF is a application aimed at reducing the loudness of tinnitus through listening to tailor-made music without the frequencies that correspond to an individual’s tinnitus frequency. The app identifies a one-octave band around the patient’s tinnitus frequency and removes it from the music’s energy spectrum. After six month to one year of listening to this “notched” music, patients have reported a significant reduction in the loudness of ringing compared to a group of tinnitus patients who listened to music in which frequencies were randomly removed. 
We cannot predict the specific percentage reduction in tinnitus volume in a specific case. However, during the scientific experiments conducted by researchers, Reduction of Tinnitus loudness by an average of approximately 20% after five days of therapy, listening at 3 to 6 hours over those five days, as well as an average of approximately 27% after twelve months, listening for 2 hours daily.<br />
This therapy has only recently been developed and there are no multi-year follow-up studies done (yet). So the data needed to answer this question isn’t available yet. If You only use the app for a very short time (a couple of days), the Tinnitus volume reduction will not be permanent and will at least partially reverse. It is important to spend several months, a few hours a day, listening to the notched music.<br /><br /><br />
    <h4>What are the risks of TinnitusOFF?</h4>
     In few cases, including high perceptive person and multitonal tinnitus, listening to TinnitusOFF Therapy can temporarily increase the volume of Your tinnitus at rest with no external sound input other than ambient noise from a regular environment. This is temporary and reversible with cessation of therapy.<br /> 
It can occur due to Listening to Notched Sound Therapy at an unsafe volume level (exceeding 85 dB), as any loud noise can exacerbate tinnitus if it is too loud, Incorrect detection of tinnitus frequency, resulting in a "Notch" that does not overlay the user’s actual tinnitus frequency.
However, some users have correctly detected their tinnitus frequency and listen at a safe volume level, and despite this, they experience an increase in the volume of their tinnitus. This has been described in rare cases to psycho-acoustic phenomena known as a "Zwicker tone". Furthermore, it may be due to differences in the particular pattern of tinnitus that these individuals have compared to those users who do benefit from listening to the therapy.<br />
If this occurs to You while You are using TinnitusOFF, take the following steps:<br /> 
Verify that the therapy is in fact not working. For example, a user reported increase of tone immediately following a session of TinnitusOFF, however, he still experienced a net decrease in his baseline tinnitus volume, resulting in an overall decrease in tinnitus volume.<br />
Verify that You have correctly detected Your tinnitus frequency (to the best of Your ability) and that You are not listening at an unsafe volume level.<br /> 
If the above steps fail, stop listening to Notched Sound Therapy. After a rest period, Your baseline tinnitus volume will return to its normal level.<br />  
This complication occurs at a low rate. We currently estimate it at 5%. and periodically re-assess our internal data to update this figure. Most importantly, it is reversible upon cessation of the therapy.<br />
