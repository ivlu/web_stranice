        <strong>Thank You for choosing TinnitusOFF!</strong> <br />    
         We believe we can help You to reduce the loudness of the constant ringing that freaks You out.
By downloading this app, there’s a high probability that, together with 200 million people around the world, you suffer from constantly hearing a loud, permanent, high frequency ringing.<br /> 
After 2010 a new field of therapy emerged involving the removal of the frequency you perceive as your own tinnitus tone from... your favorite music. This type of therapy for tinnitus is called <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full.pdf">Tailor-Made Notched Music therapy.</a><br /> 
Based on this concept, our music player enables you to notch out the frequency of your tinnitus tone, while listening to your favorite music.<br /> <br /> <br /> 
        <strong>Three easy steps to begin the therapy:</strong> <br /> 
        <ol>
            <li>Find the frequency of your own tinnitus tone. Feel the tone melting? Save it. It’s Your own tinnitus tone.</li> 
            <li>Upload the music you like.</li> 
            <li>Listen to the music you like.</li> 
        </ol>
        After opening the app, you will be asked to detect and save the frequency of your tone, by dragging your finger up and down along the scale on the right.<br /> 
Once you select your frequency, you can upload any song from your device and create your playlist. You can then listen to songs you like, while our filter is notching your tone’s frequency from these songs.<br /> 
Sustained listening to this therapy lowers the volume of tinnitus, alleviating the considerable suffering caused by this terrible illness, and the mechanism has been now demonstrated in one of the leading scientific journal in the world, Proceedings of National Academy of Science.<br /> 
Listening to music using tailor-made notched sound therapy targets the auditory neurons next to the ones that produce tinnitus, wiring them, and doing so, reducing the activity of the neuron that produce ringing in the ears by lateral inhibition; a key feature in all brain sensory processing.<br /> 
 it is important to periodically check one’s tinnitus frequency by making a new profile to make sure that the “notch” lines up correctly with your, current, tinnitus frequency.<br /> 
When listening, keep a comfortable volume. High volume listening may worsen your tinnitus.<br /> 
Are there side effects?<br /> 
In around 5 to 8 % of people suffering from tinnitus are highly sensitive persons. Another 5% suffer from multi-tonal tinnitus. If You are part of these subcategories, the loudness is reported to increase, Just stop the therapy, This is temporary and reversible with cessation of therapy. After a rest period, your baseline tinnitus volume will return to prior level. This increase of loudness can also occur in incorrectly detected tinnitus frequency or due to listening at an unsafe volume level (more than 85db)<br /> <br /> <br />
